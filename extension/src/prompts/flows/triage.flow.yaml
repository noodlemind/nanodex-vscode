      Present all findings, decisions, or issues here one by one for triage. The goal is to go through each item and decide whether to add it to the CLI todo system.

      **IMPORTANT: DO NOT CODE ANYTHING DURING TRIAGE!**

      This command is for:
      - Triaging code review findings
      - Processing security audit results
      - Reviewing performance analysis
      - Handling any other categorized findings that need tracking

      For each finding, present in this format:

      ```
      ---
      Issue #X: [Brief Title]

      Severity: 🔴 P1 (CRITICAL) / 🟡 P2 (IMPORTANT) / 🔵 P3 (NICE-TO-HAVE)

      Category: [Security/Performance/Architecture/Bug/Feature/etc.]

      Description:
      [Detailed explanation of the issue or improvement]

      Location: [file_path:line_number]

      Problem Scenario:
      [Step by step what's wrong or could happen]

      Proposed Solution:
      [How to fix it]

      Estimated Effort: [Small (< 2 hours) / Medium (2-8 hours) / Large (> 8 hours)]

      ---
      Do you want to add this to the todo list?
      1. yes - create todo file
      2. next - skip this item
      3. custom - modify before creating
      ```

      Every time you present the to-do as a header, can you say what the progress of the triage is, how many we have done and how many are left, and an estimated time for completion, looking at how quickly we go through them as well?

      **When user says "yes":**

      1. **Determine next issue ID:**
         ```bash
         ls todos/ | grep -o '^[0-9]\+' | sort -n | tail -1
         ```

      2. **Create filename:**
         ```
         {next_id}-pending-{priority}-{brief-description}.md
         ```

         Priority mapping:
         - 🔴 P1 (CRITICAL) → `p1`
         - 🟡 P2 (IMPORTANT) → `p2`
         - 🔵 P3 (NICE-TO-HAVE) → `p3`

         Example: `042-pending-p1-transaction-boundaries.md`

      3. **Create from template:**
         ```bash
         cp todos/000-pending-p1-TEMPLATE.md todos/{new_filename}
         ```

      4. **Populate the file:**
         ```yaml
         ---
         status: pending
         priority: p1  # or p2, p3 based on severity
         issue_id: "042"
         tags: [category, relevant-tags]
         dependencies: []

         **By:** Claude Triage System
         **Actions:**
         - Issue discovered during [triage session type]
         - Categorized as {severity}
         - Estimated effort: {effort}

         ```

      5. **Confirm creation:**
         "✅ Created: `{filename}` - Issue #{issue_id}"

      **When user says "next":**
      - Skip to the next item
      - Track skipped items for summary

      **When user says "custom":**
      - Ask what to modify (priority, description, details)
      - Update the information
      - Present revised version
      - Ask again: yes/next/custom

      Do not code, and if you say yes, make sure to mark the to-do as ready to pick up or something. If you make any changes, update the file and then continue to read the next one. If next is selected make sure to remove the to-do from the list since its not relevant.

      ### Next Steps:
      1. Review pending todos: `ls todos/*-pending-*.md`
      2. Approve for work: Move from pending → ready status
      3. Start work: Use `/resolve_todo_parallel` or pick individually
