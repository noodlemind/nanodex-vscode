      ### Phase 1: Environment Setup

      1. **Update Main Branch**

         ```bash
         git checkout main
         git pull origin main
         ```

      2. **Create Feature Branch and Worktree**

         - Determine appropriate branch name from document
         - Get the root directory of the Git repository:

         ```bash
         git_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
         ```

         - Create worktrees directory if it doesn't exist:

         ```bash
         mkdir -p "$git_root/.worktrees"
         ```

         - Add .worktrees to .gitignore if not already there:

         ```bash
         if ! grep -q "^\.worktrees$" "$git_root/.gitignore"; then
           echo ".worktrees" >> "$git_root/.gitignore"
         fi
         ```

         - Create the new worktree with feature branch:

         ```bash
         git worktree add -b feature-branch-name "$git_root/.worktrees/feature-branch-name" main
         ```

         - Change to the new worktree directory:

         ```bash
         cd "$git_root/.worktrees/feature-branch-name"
         ```

      3. **Verify Environment**
         - Confirm in correct worktree directory
         - Install dependencies if needed
         - Run initial tests to ensure clean state

    agentId: "nanodex.specialist.repo-research-analyst"
    prompt: |
      ### Phase 2: Document Analysis and Planning

      1. **Read Input Document**

         - Use Read tool to examine the work document
         - Identify all deliverables and requirements
         - Note any constraints or dependencies
         - Extract success criteria

      2. **Create Task Breakdown**

         - Convert requirements into specific tasks
         - Add implementation details for each task
         - Include testing and validation steps
         - Consider edge cases and error handling

      3. **Build Todo List**
         - Use TodoWrite to create comprehensive list
         - Set priorities based on dependencies
         - Include all subtasks and checkpoints
         - Add documentation and review tasks

      ### Phase 3: Systematic Execution

      1. **Task Execution Loop**

         ```
         while (tasks remain):
           - Select next task (priority + dependencies)
           - Mark as in_progress
           - Execute task completely
           - Validate completion
           - Mark as completed
           - Update progress
         ```

      2. **Quality Assurance**

         - Run tests after each task
         - Execute lint and typecheck commands
         - Verify no regressions
         - Check against acceptance criteria
         - Document any issues found

      3. **Progress Tracking**
         - Regularly update task status
         - Note any blockers or delays
         - Create new tasks for discoveries
         - Maintain work visibility

      ### Phase 4: Completion and Submission

      1. **Final Validation**

         - Verify all tasks completed
         - Run comprehensive test suite
         - Execute final lint and typecheck
         - Check all deliverables present
         - Ensure documentation updated

      2. **Prepare for Submission**

         - Stage and commit all changes
         - Write commit messages
         - Push feature branch to remote
         - Create detailed pull request

      3. **Create Pull Request**
         ```bash
         git push -u origin feature-branch-name
         gh pr create --title "Feature: [Description]" --body "[Detailed description]"
         ```
