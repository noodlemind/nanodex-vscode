## 🎯 How to Use

### Update Issue #4 (Recommended)

Since I cannot directly update GitHub issues via API:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/noodlemind/nanodex-vscode/issues/4
2. Click "Edit" on the issue
3. Copy content from `/tmp/issue-4-final.md`
4. Replace the current issue description
5. Click "Update comment"

**Optional:** Add `/tmp/issue-4-comprehensive-description.md` as a pinned comment for full technical details

### Alternative: Keep as Reference

Move files from `/tmp/` to `docs/planning/` or `.github/` and link from Issue #4

## ✅ Next Steps

After updating Issue #4:

1. **Review** the comprehensive plan with stakeholders
2. **Prioritize** features based on user demand and strategic goals
3. **Create sub-issues** for each major feature (optional)
4. **Set milestones** for v0.6.0, v0.7.0, etc.
5. **Begin implementation** starting with highest priority features

## 📝 Notes

- All effort estimates include testing and documentation
- Roadmap is flexible and can be adjusted
- Risk mitigation strategies provided for each feature
- Privacy-first approach documented for telemetry feature
- Each feature has clear acceptance criteria
